*The general idea of this project is to create a Audio Visualizer from user inputted files.
*The ideal functionality of the project would be:
-Get the user to start the application
-Get the user to import an audio file
-The program will decode analog data from audio files, and organize them into subsets of data that would occur at a time t
-The data at time t will be transmitted to models and will take on a shape and color depending on the data and time collected, which will animate the audio.
-The user will be able to interact with the UI to play, pause, or import a new file. (Maybe a timeline will be implemented to allow the user to go back or ahead on the track)
-The user's audio file will play alongside the visualization.
